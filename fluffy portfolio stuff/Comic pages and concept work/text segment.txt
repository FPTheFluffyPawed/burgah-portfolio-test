Through either self publishing or collaboration with other artists, I have contributed work towards multiple comic or magazine projects, meeting set deadlines and providing comics or designs fulfilling the requirements set by organisers. The included works consist of pages from "Psychic Wars", a short comic in the ConfliX independant Zine I have published, and Concept work for "The Hand Of God", an ongoing project I am collaborating on with a seperate writer.
